# Cats-Actors

Cats-Actors is a functional programming-based actor system derived from Akka v2.6.21.

## Acknowledgments

This project is a derivative work of [Akka](https://www.akka.io/), developed by Lightbend, Inc. and other contributors. Significant modifications have been made to rewrite the actor system and actor cell to use functional programming principles and fibers.

The code follows the same design philosophy as the original Akka source code but has been modified to use Cats and Cats-Effect libraries. It achieves high concurrency by using actors. This project can be considered an abstraction of Cats-Effect and FS2, providing an actor-based experience and higher-level abstractions to achieve high concurrency.
